NTSYS pc stands for Numerical Taxonomy System for Personal Computers. It is a software package developed by F. James Rohlf at Stony Brook University. It has been used by thousands of researchers and students in various fields such as biology, ecology, anthropology, psychology, linguistics, and more. NTSYS pc can handle large datasets with ease and perform a wide range of analyses such as cluster analysis, principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, canonical variates analysis, and many more.
 
The latest version of NTSYS pc is 2.2 12, which was released on February 25, 2021. This version has several improvements and bug fixes over the previous versions. Some of the new features include:
 
- A new module called SIMTEST that can test the significance of similarity coefficients using randomization or bootstrap methods.
- A new option in the MDS module that can perform nonmetric multidimensional scaling using the SMACOF algorithm.
- A new option in the PCA module that can perform robust principal components analysis using the ROBPCA algorithm.
- A new option in the CVAPLOT module that can plot canonical variates scores with confidence ellipses.
- A new option in the SIMINT module that can compute similarity intervals for similarity coefficients using bootstrap methods.
- A new option in the SIMCOV module that can compute similarity matrices based on covariance or correlation matrices.
- A new option in the SIMPROF module that can perform similarity profile analysis to test for significant differences among groups of objects.
- A new option in the SIMCA module that can perform soft independent modeling of class analogy to classify objects into groups based on similarity coefficients.
- A new option in the SIMPER module that can perform similarity percentages analysis to identify the variables that contribute most to the dissimilarity among groups of objects.
- A new option in the SIMMAT module that can perform matrix permutation tests to compare two similarity matrices.
